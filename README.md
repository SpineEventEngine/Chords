A suite of libraries for UI development with Compose Multiplatform toolkit

> Note: the libraries are currently on an experimental stage.

This suite contains the following libraries:
- [core](core/README.md) — a basis for writing desktop applications with Compose. 
- [protobuf](protobuf/README.md) — domain-specific UI components that operate with models defined
  as Protobuf messages.
- [proto-values](proto-values/README.md) — Protobuf messages and extensions that complement the ones
  found in standard Spine libraries, and are required by the `protobuf` library.
- [client](client/README.md) — components that support server connectivity using
  the [Spine Event Engine](https://spine.io/).
