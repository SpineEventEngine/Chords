/**
 * An object that dispatches a focus request to a component that owns
 * this dispatcher.
 *
 * A component that was given this dispatcher has to ensure that incoming focus
 * requests are handled by the component in one of two ways:
 * - One way is to assign the [requester] onto the component using
 *   the component's [Modifier.focusRequester]. This would typically be more
 *   appropriate for simple components.
 * - Another way is to specify a [handleFocusRequest] callback, which would
 *   focus the component. This way is more universal and can be more relevant in
 *   cases when a component associated with this [FocusRequestDispatcher] is
 *   a complex component consisting of several focusable fields, which might
 *   require some logic for choosing which field should be focused at the time
 *   of receiving such a request.
 *
 *   @param focusRequester
 *           [FocusRequester] which should receive focus requests, if specified.
