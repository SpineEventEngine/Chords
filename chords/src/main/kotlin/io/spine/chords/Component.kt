/**
 * A base class for class-based component implementations.
 *
 * A notion of class-based components that is introduced with this class
 * provides an alternative way for implementing components with utilizing
 * the features of the object-oriented paradigm.
 *
 * ### Using class-based components
 *
 * The syntax for using such components is similar to that of using the regular
 * function-based components. Considering a function-based component declaration
 * like this:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 *     SomeComponent(
 *         parameter1 = value1,
 *         parameter2 = value2,
 *         ...
 *     )
 * ```
 *
 * The usage of an analogous class-based component would look like this:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 *     SomeComponent {
 *         property1 = value1
 *         property2 = value2
 *         ...
 *     }
 * ```
 *
 * Such a component usage expression is called a _component's instance
 * declaration_. It both lazily creates and remembers a component's instance for
 * this invocation site, and also renders the component (similar to regular
 * function-based components).
 *
 * The lambda passed in such a declaration is invoked before each
 * recomposition of the component, which, similar to function-based components,
 * results in each component's recomposition to run with the up-to-date
 * parameters (property values).
 *
 * A respective component instance is cached using [remember] for each of such
 * respective component's usage sites, so the same instance will be reused for
 * each respective declaration. You can obtain a reference to a component's
 * instance as follows, if needed:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 *     val someComponent = SomeComponent { ... }
 * ```
 *
 * It should be noted that such a declaration is technically not the same as
 * just instantiating the component with its constructor. A component's
 * constructor is typically held private or protected and not used directly.
 * Instead of using the constructor, such expressions work due to
 * the [invoke][ComponentCompanion.invoke] operator declared on the component's
 * companion object. See below how to implement such components.
 *
 * ### Implementing class-based components
 *
 * - Create a subclass of [Component] (make sure to make its constructor to
 *   be private or protected though).
 *
 * - Add a companion object of type [ComponentCompanion], which introduces
 *   the instance declaration API (which is technically being an invocation).
 *
 *   You can consider the presence of this companion object as a kind of
 *   replacement for a public constructor (albeit it actually both ensures
 *   a lazy component's creation, and its rendering at the same time).
 *
 *   Note: abstract base components do not need this companion object
 *   (since they would never be instantiated and used by themselves).
 *
 * - Implement the composable [content] method to have the component's
 *   rendering code â€” any respective component's composable content that should
 *   be displayed in the component, just like implementing regular
 *   composable functions.
 *
 * - Declare a mutable property for each "parameter" of your component.
 *
 * Here's an example of creating an input component that allows entering
 * a string value:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 *     public class HelloComponent : Component() {
 *         public companion object : ComponentCompanion<HelloComponent>({
 *             HelloComponent()
 *         })
 *
 *         public var name: String = ""
 *
 *         @Composable
 *         override fun content() {
 *             Text("Hello, $name")
 *         }
 *     }
 * ```
 *
 * Such a component can be used like this:
 * ```kotlin
 *     HelloComponent { name = "User" }
 * ```
 *
 * ### When to write class-based and function-based components?
 *
 * A class-based components writing style is only a convenience that can be used
 * if it provides some benefits relative to function-based ones. Function-based
 * components can still be written whenever that seems
 * more convenient/appropriate.
 *
 * Both paradigms are mutually compatible: functional components can be used in
 * class-based ones, and class-based ones can be used in functional ones.
 *
 * ### Benefits of writing class-based components
 *
 * A class-based component implementation provides the following benefits
 * in particular:
 *
 * - **Implicit component instance creation**. A component's instance is
 *   implicitly created and remembered for every component's declaration
 *   (usage) site.
 *
 * - **Support for imperative API**. Introducing the notion of component
 *   instances makes it trivial to create imperative parts of component's API.
 *   For example things like focusing a component (see
 *   the [focus][InputComponent.focus] function) can now be made in a more
 *   straightforward style than the classical Compose's way
 *   (see `Modifier.focusRequester()`).
 *
 *   ```kotlin
 *       someComponent.focus()
 *   ```
 *
 * - The component's implementation can place any data that needs to be
 *   remembered across recompositions into component's private properties
 *   instead of declaring the [remember] section to store each of such values.
 *
 * - **Reuse and standardization of common concepts**. It becomes possible to
 *   easily standardize the concepts common for all similar components
 *   (e.g. concepts reused in all input components) by extracting them into base
 *   class(es). For example, the input component's parameters such as its value,
 *   validity state ([valueValid][InputComponent.valueValid]), external
 *   validation message
 *   ([externalValidationMessage][InputComponent.externalValidationMessage]),
 *   etc. can be declared and documented as properties in the respective base
 *   class without such things in all components.
 *
 * - **More compact definition of component hierarchies**.
 *
 *   In a purely functional style multi-level component hierarchies are
 *   typically implemented with composition involving a notable amount of
 *   "bureaucracy" for passing many component's parameters to their "nested"
 *   components.
 *
 *   Class inheritance would implicitly make all parent's properties available
 *   to descendant implementations (no need for many explicit parameter
 *   specifications like `param1 = param1` in such cases).
 *
 * - **Encapsulation benefits**: clear implementation boundaries, implicit access
 *   to all properties in all functions.
 *
 *   If a component requires some extra functions for its functioning, it's easy
 *   to declare them as component class's methods, which makes component's
 *   implementation boundaries more explicit, and also makes all component's
 *   data (stored in its properties) to be implicitly available in each of such
 *   functions without explicitly passing them around with parameters.
 *
 * ### Converting function-based components into class-based ones
 *
 * The points below can be used as a rule of thumb when converting existing
 * function-based components to class-based ones. This can also be helpful for
 * understanding the differences between the two component writing paradigms.
 *
 * - A class should be created instead of a composable function. Its name is
 *   generally expected to be the same as the function that is being converted.
 *
 * - This class should extend the [Component] class (or some of its subclasses).
 *
 * - Each parameter of a component (which would be passed as a parameter to
 *   a function-based component), should be declared as a mutable public
 *   property `public var ...`.
 *
 * - The actual composable content of the component (content of the composable
 *   function that is being transformed into a class-based component) is
 *   placed inside an overridden [content] method (which is declared as
 *   a `@Composable` one as well).
 *
 * - Class-based components are typically never instantiated directly via their
 *   constructor (see "Using class-based components")! Instead, they are
 *   technically "invoked" via an `invoke` operator on their companion object.
 *   To ensure this usage syntax, the following should be done:
 *
 *   - Add a public companion object that extends `ComponentCompanion` (or its
 *     subclass, e.g. if you're extending a subclass of `Component`).
 *
 *   See the details in the "Implementing class-based components" section above.
 *
 * - Consider transforming variables whose values are cached with [remember]
 *   in a function-based component to be private or protected class's
 *   properties instead.
 *
 *   You can still use `remember` if needed, but please note that the whole
 *   component's instance is already automatically `remember`-ed, which means
 *   that you can often just store such data in its properties in such cases.
 *
 * - If your composable components has some nested functions and/or big lambdas,
 *   consider transforming them into methods of the component's class.
 *
 * - Likewise, if there are any additional functions that you consider to be
 *   a part of the component, consider making them to be methods of
 *   the component's class.
 *
 *   This can especially be appropriate if you had to pass some of the variables
 *   with `remember`-ed values into such functions. Transforming such functions
 *   into class methods would make respective class's properties to be available
 *   to such methods implicitly.
 *
 * @constructor a constructor, which is used internally by the component's
 *         implementation (its companion object). As an application developer,
 *         use [companion object's][ComponentCompanion]
 *         [invoke][ComponentCompanion.invoke] operator for instantiating
 *         and rendering any specific component's implementation.

 * A companion object type that introduces a component's instance

 *
 * This is a base class that should normally be used for a companion object of
 * any non-abstract class-based component (a direct or indirect descendant of
 * [Component]), to provide a top-level API for component instance
 * declaration expressions.
 *
 * Please note that component's constructor(s) themselves shouldn't be used
 * directly for instantiating components, and are considered to be internal to
 * the component's implementation (technically being `private` or `protected`).
 * Instead of this, component instances should be _declared_ using one of
 * the [invoke] operators on the respective component's companion object.
 *
 * Once this type is added as a companion object to some respective component
 * type (e.g., `SomeComponent` for an example), an instance of the respective
 * component can be declared like this:
 *
 * ```
 *     SomeComponent {

/**
 * This function can be used to work around what appears to be a bug in Compose,
 * where an internal Compose's exception is thrown during recompositions of
 * overridden `open` composable methods.
 *
 * ### What the bug looks like
 *
 * The issue manifests itself by throwing an exception like this:
 * ```
 *     Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" androidx.compose.runtime.ComposeRuntimeError:
 *     Compose Runtime internal error. Unexpected or incorrect use of the Compose
 *     internal runtime API (Cannot seek outside the current group (101-105)).
 *     Please report to Google or use https://goo.gle/compose-feedback
 * ```
 *
 * Another variant of the message in parentheses above that was seen in
 * apparently the same circumstances looked like this:
 * ```
 *     Cannot reposition while in an empty region
 * ```
 *
 * The bug has been reported here (for Compose Multiplatform):
 *   [https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform/issues/4491](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform/issues/4491),
 * and also a duplicate was reported here (for Jetpack Compose):
 *   [https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/329477544](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/329477544)
 *
 * A similar (likely the same) issue was also found to be reported for Jetpack
 * Compose here:
 *   [https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/254292974](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/254292974)
 *
 * ### When it appears
 *
 * At least in the case that was investigated, the pattern that was causing
 * a bug was like this:
 *
 * - There's a parent class `A` with a non-abstract, but open composable method
 *   named `content` (the actual names don't matter). It's enough for this
 *   method to contain nothing but access some
 *   [State][androidx.compose.runtime.State] that would trigger
 *   its recomposition.
 * - There's a subclass `B`, which extends class `A`, and overrides its
 *   `content` method. It's enough that it just calls `super.content()` for
 *   the bug to appear.
 * - Triggering recomposition of `A.content` (e.g. by changing
 *   a [State][androidx.compose.runtime.State]'s value that is read in its
 *   implementation) causes the exception mentioned above to appear.
 *
 *   See an example [here](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/329477544).
 *
 * ### The workaround
 *
 * It was found that for such a configuration it is enough to wrap
 * the implementation of composable method with another composable method that
 * doesn't introduce anything by itself except such wrapping.
 *
 * ### How to use this method
 *
 * If you encounter the bug mentioned above:
 *
 * - Find such a method that is being recomposed when the exception appears,
 *   which triggers the exception.
 *   - It is expected that it should be an open composable method in some parent
 *     class, and this method is overridden in a class (component) that is being
 *     used when the exception appears.
 *   - It's likely NOT a method that is either private, or final, or not `open`
 *     or `override` one, or the one that's not overridden in any subclasses.
 *   - The [Component.content] method's implementation in some of the parent
 *     component classes might be the one of typical cases.
 *
 * - Wrap the content of that method with this function, e.g. like this:
 *   ```kotlin
 *       override fun content(): Unit = recompositionWorkaround {
 *           // original method's content
 *       }
 *   ```
 *
 * - Please do not wrap any methods just in case, without confirming that it is
 *   exactly the one that triggers the problem.
 *
 * - If you find that this function should be applied in some other cases than
 *   described here, please update these instructions to be up-to-date.
 *
 * @param content
 *         the composable content in a parent composable method, whose
 *         recomposition was found to trigger the bug.
 * @return the wrapped composable content intended to fix the bug.
